## Student Placement Prediction Project

Welcome to the Student Placement Prediction project repository! This project focuses on predicting student placements based on various factors.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Imported and cleaned a dataset consisting of 700 student records using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- **Missing Data Inference**: Conducted extensive testing to infer missing data and identify variables influencing student placements.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed predictive models including linear regression, decision trees, and random forest classifiers to forecast student placements.

### Repository Contents:
- **Python Scripts**: Contains scripts used for data preprocessing, missing data inference, and predictive modeling.
- **Data Files**: Includes the dataset used for analysis.
- **Power Point**: Includes furthur analysis on predicitve models generated. 

Feel free to explore the code and notebooks to gain insights into the student placement prediction process. Contributions and feedback are always appreciated!
